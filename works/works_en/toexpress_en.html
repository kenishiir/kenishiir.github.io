              In this work a line is one series og acions which constitute a story. Each story could be told from various points of view. The story run through the world that has a time and a space: the diegesis.<br>

            <h2>About the "Narrative"</h2>
            <p>
                In order to explain the "narrative", I would like to decide a brief definition. The "narrative" is: an act of telling a story as a narrator to a listner.<br>
                The "narrative" can be divided by it "content" and the "act" itself. The content of a "narrative" refers to the events that actually occured. For example, the "content" of my breakfast is : First I eat a salad, Then had a piece of bread and a fried egg. Finally I drink coffee. The "content" is a list of events.<br>
                This work is focused on the length and the order of the "content" and the "act".<br>
                The length of the "content" and the "act" is different. The length to actually have breakfast is about 20 minutes, but to tell the story, it could be done in one phrase: "I had breakfast".<br>
                Also, the order changes in the "content" and the "act". To tell a story effectly the order of actions could be changed.
